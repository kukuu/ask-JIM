# "Ask-JIM"


The **JIM** AI Engine is a unique custom domain AI LLM NLP ML RAG pipeline.

It's server component file leverages as its core LLM-NLP-RAG pipeline orchestrator through a sophisticated multi-layered algorithm that processes natural language queries against real-time energy data. The pipeline begins with an HTTP POST endpoint (/api/llm/query) that receives user questions and employs pattern-matching NLP to categorize queries into specific analytical domains - statistical analysis, load forecasting, performance evaluation, or tariff optimization.

When a query contains statistical keywords like "stat" or "analysis," JIM executes a true RAG pipeline by querying Supabase for the latest 50 meter readings, then performs real-time aggregation to calculate averages, maximums, and minimums per meter. For load-related queries, the engine simulates predictive scenarios using the same consumption algorithms that generate live meter data, applying 20-25% load increases and calculating corresponding cost impacts based on time-of-use tariff structures.

The RAG component dynamically constructs context by analyzing temporal patterns from the database, identifying peak consumption hours (2:00 PM - 6:00 PM) and correlating them with tariff rates. For performance optimization queries, JIM implements anomaly detection by comparing meter fluctuations against baseline consumption patterns, flagging Meter 3's peak-hour spikes as optimization targets.

The pipeline's intelligence is enhanced by the server component file's real-time data simulation, which models UK electricity usage patterns with peak-hour multipliers (1.5x-2x normal consumption) and overnight reductions (50-70%). This simulated data provides the training context for JIM's analytical responses, enabling it to make evidence-based recommendations like load shifting strategies that could yield 10-15% savings.

**JIM**'s response generation employs dynamic templated HTML output with structured data visualization, presenting findings through categorized statistics, bullet-point recommendations, and cost-impact analyses. The system maintains conversation context through timestamped question-answer pairs while enforcing data freshness by always querying the most recent 50 records.

The algorithm expects continuous real-time data ingestion from the WebSocket layer, which generates new readings every 2 seconds and persists them to Supabase every 60 seconds. This ensures JIM's analyses are always based on current system states rather than historical data alone. The health check endpoint (/health) provides pipeline monitoring, verifying both the LLM service availability and underlying data connectivity.

Ultimately, JIM transforms server2.js from a simple data simulator into an intelligent energy analytics platform by combining real-time data processing, pattern recognition, predictive modeling, and natural language understanding - all while maintaining the low-latency requirements essential for interactive energy management decision support.
